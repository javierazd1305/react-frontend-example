# React Front End simple example
This project is a simple frontend/pwa using react and [django server](https://github.com/javierazd1305/django-backend-example) Simple post request to de server side.

# Usage
```python
git clone https://github.com/javierazd1305/react-frontend-example.git
npm install
npm start
```
The http request is using axios and the example is in the src/Feature.index.js file. 

# Deploy
There are several options to deploy react apps, but in my opinions [vercel](https://vercel.com/) is the best option. Just push this project to your github account and connect it. Check the [production example here](https://react-frontend-example.vercel.app/)

# Recommendations
* I left all the files when use react-create-app, but you can delete some of them like de images. 
* Test your changes with lighthouse to verify your [Progressive Web App (PWA)](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/) because there are plenty of benefits to your end users.
